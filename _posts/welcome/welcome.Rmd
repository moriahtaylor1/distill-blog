Hi all! My name is Moriah Taylor and I am an analyst by trade and a data lover at heart. I am a content creator on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/moriah_taylor58) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/moriah_streamr). Most of my content focuses on:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Data Wrangling  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Data Visualization  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Data Analysis  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Best practices for all of the above  

The goal of this blog is to complement the content that I already produce, as well as provide a space for longer-form content on topics that can't be covered in a series of tweets. I am very excited about this project and hope you all enjoy it!
