    "contents": "\r\nHi all! My name is Moriah Taylor and I am an analyst by trade and a data lover at heart. I am a content creator on Twitter and Twitch. Most of my content focuses on:\r\n    ● Data Wrangling\r\n    ● Data Visualization\r\n    ● Data Analysis\r\n    ● Best practices for all of the above\r\nThe goal of this blog is to complement the content that I already produce, as well as provide a space for longer-form content on topics that can’t be covered in a series of tweets. I am very excited about this project and hope you all enjoy it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
